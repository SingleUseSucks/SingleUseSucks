        <p class="font-abel text-black text-[16px]">Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental issues, as rapidly increasing production of disposable plastic products  overwhelms the world’s ability to deal with them. Plastic pollution is  most visible in developing Asian and African nations, where garbage  collection systems are often inefficient or nonexistent. But the  developed world, especially in countries with low recycling rates, also has trouble properly collecting discarded plastics. Plastic trash has become so ubiquitous it has prompted efforts to write a global treaty negotiated by the United Nations.</p>

            <h2 class="font-abel text-black text-[64px] pb-8">Micro-plastics</h2>
            <p class="font-abel text-black text-[16px]">Once at sea, sunlight, wind, and wave action break down plastic waste into small particles, often less than one-fifth of an inch across. These so-called microplastics are spread throughout the water column and have been found in every corner of the globe, from Mount Everest, the highest peak, to the Mariana Trench, the deepest trough. Microplastics are breaking down further into smaller and smaller pieces. Plastic microfibers, meanwhile, have been found in municipal drinking water systems and drifting through the air.</p>
            <p class="font-abel text-black text-[16px] pt-4">It's no surprise then that scientists have found microplastics in people. The tiny particles are in our blood, lungs, and even in feces. Exactly how much microplastics might be harming human health is a question scientists are urgently trying to answer.</p>

    <div>
        <h3 class="font-abel text-black font-semibold text-[20px] pb-8">Here are some thought provoking facts from the National Geographic about plastic pollution:</h3>
        <ul class="pl-16">
            <li class="list-disc font-abel text-black text-[16px] py-1">Production increased exponentially, from 2.3 million tons in 1950 to 448 million tons by 2015. Production is expected to double by 2050.</li>
            <li class="list-disc font-abel text-black text-[16px] py-1">Every year, about eight million tons of plastic waste escapes into the oceans from coastal nations. That’s the equivalent of setting five garbage bags full of trash on every foot of coastline around the world.</li>
            <li class="list-disc font-abel text-black text-[16px] py-1">Plastics often contain additives making them stronger, more flexible, and durable. But many of these additives can extend the life of products if they become litter, with some estimates ranging to at least 400 years to break down.</li>
